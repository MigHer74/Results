# Results

This program is my first time in Python; the main idea is to obtain how many times a number is repeating in a list of 36 and 108 numbers.

I based the idea in the results of a local lottery who play every week, so each list is the result of the winner combination.

After enter the data of each week, the program gives the numbers who has 2, 3, 4 and 5 or more repetitions separately in the shorter version of the game (36 numbers version) and in the version with 108 numbers the gives the numbers who has 3, 4, 5 and 6 or more repetitions.

The file named "minis.py" contains the functions of the main program.

There are two files with the numbers. One of them contains 18 numbers, is the shorter version of the game; the other file contains 36 numbers is the longest version of the game.

I'm using lists and statements if, elif and for.

The program is still growing, so I'm going to still update the progress.
