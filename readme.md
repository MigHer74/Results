# Results

This program is my first time in Python; the main idea is to obtain how many times a number is repeating in a list of 36 numbers.

I based the idea in the results of a local lottery who play every week, so each list is the result of the winner combination.

The 36 numbers are separated in 6 list of 6 numbers each, each list is the weekly winner combination.

After enter the data of each week, the program gives the numbers who has 2, 3, 4 and 5 or more repetitions of that 36 numbers separately.

I'm using lists and statements if, elif and for.

The program is still growing, so I'm going to still update the progress.
